Suggested:
You can use an LSTM with two outputs or you can use an MLP with two outputs to model this problem.

back propagation with sliding window python for dates

RBF if we consider it's based on first few numbers or previous rounds

TDNN for one based on a specific input like time or ticket number

k-means clustering

Back probagation might work too

My guess:
Robust nonlinear regression
Differential Evolution uses the Latin Hypercube algorithm

maybe even like the above unsupervised... just learn to guess
